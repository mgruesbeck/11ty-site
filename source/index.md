Head of Operations

## Summary

Hello,

I’m currently Head of Operations at [Profluent](https://www.profluent.bio/), a startup developing machine learning models that can read and write biomolecules. I found operations as a prototype designer when I discovered designing user flows was analogous to designing business processes.

As a prototype designer I worked in a computer vision and NLP setting, first as an early [MetaMind](https://venturebeat.com/2016/04/04/salesforce-buys-hot-deep-learning-startup-metamind-services-shutting-down-may-4/) employee, and later as a founding member of [Salesforce Research](https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/). Prior to that, I founded a design agency in Napa Valley.

Broadly speaking, I love thinking about incentives, systems, and tasks. And, how each relates to products, processes, and the people that interact with them. I get work done with: 11ty, Figma, Git, Javascript, Node, SVG, Unix, Notion, Rippling and more.

On weekends I [ski](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbLvhBKPDY-/), [mountaineer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ol8zGVx0idn4PJfGxyta_36Oga0kMZm5m3He03T-JCc/edit), [paraglide](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_d7F5YhUcD/), and make nerdy [spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/140L1GhbZXHXsbJdI6eYurpDyTWKa8owp57K_modYM7w/edit?usp=sharing).
